# A simple video transcoding app using MediaCodec + Hardware Acceleration

A lot of this vibe-coded with Jules. Seems to work for what I need it to do though.

I love and use FFShare, but ffmpeg-based transoding makes it a litte slow.

Transcoding a 120MB video to H265 (FFShare made it 720x306, VideOpt 480p - 854x480) took about 1m30s on my Pixel 9 Pro on FFShare and resulted in a 3.2MB file, vs ~ 18s in VideOpt and a 4.9MB file.
